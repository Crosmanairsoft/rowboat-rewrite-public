===== EVERYTHING BELOW HERE IS TRASH ======

== HIGH LEVEL TASKS ==

- Build out database sharding
  - Build out bot code which selects database shard
    - Queries all shards (we need all shards to be known at runtime then)
    - If it can't find the applicable shard, allocate one
    - All of the above can happen within guild acquire
  - Build out extension to peewee which adds `with_database`?
  - Build out some shitty system to copy data (maybe not now?)
  - Build out better resource control for carousel
    - Mark a resource as offline (and lock it there?)

- Build out plugin system
  - Commands
  - Listeners
  - Tasks

== ETC ==

- Setup Docker Compose
- Close out some leaks/missing edges
  - RPCClient/Server should be DRY'd
  - ^ need to handle connects/disconnects
- Build out workers system
  - Move as much as possible into here from plugins.
  - Base this off Postgres task system?
- Build a better configuration system
  - Use skema for web stuff?
  - Figure out how to build out better validation/error handling
  - Config can be loaded and cached in memory via carousel
